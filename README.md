The implementations of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)

is done.

CNN achieved an accuracy of ~98% with the layer size and window setting provided in the code.

Whereas, RNN along with the use of LSTM cells (Long Short Term Memory) provided accuracy

of ~99%.

The CNN is further implemented using high-level abstraction "tflearn".

This improved the accuracy of CNN slightly just over 99%.
